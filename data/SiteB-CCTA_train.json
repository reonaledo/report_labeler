More than one modifiers can be applicable:\n- N: If \"Limited evaluation due to severe motion artifacts\" is present, it can be non-diagnostic. Coronary artery stenosis can be described with motion artifacts if evaluated with low diagnostic confidence, so it is not \"non-diagnostic.\" In addition, motion artifacts can involve only the coronary artery branch. It is not non-diagnostic because other coronary arteries were evaluated.\n- HRP: High-risk plaque includes plaque with positive remodeling or low-attenuation plaque or spotty calcification in the plaque, or the napkin-ring sign. “napkin ring sign” defined in a non-calcified plaque cross-sectional image by the presence of two features: a central area of low attenuation plaque that is apparently in contact with the lumen; and a ring-like peripheral rim of higher CT attenuation surrounding this central area.\n- I: Use only if the report explicitly includes perfusion results from specific CT protocols such as CT Fractional Flow Reserve (CT-FFR) or CT perfusion (CTP). Do not apply 'I' if:\n    - The report does not include myocardial perfusion data from these specific protocols.\n    - The report only mentions myocardial thinning or motion abnormalities (e.g., hypokinesia, akinesia) without CT-FFR or CTP results.\n- S: Presence of stents. Indicates one or more coronary stents are present.\n- G: Coronary artery bypass grafts. Used when bypass grafts are present.\n- E: Used only for significant non-atherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities such as dissections, anomalous arteries, aneurysms, vasculitis, fistulas, or extrinsic compression. Does not apply to:\n    - Minor anatomical variants (e.g., short left main, myocardial bridging).\n    - Non-coronary cardiac findings (e.g., valve abnormalities, septal defects).\n    - General cardiac or vascular findings not directly affecting coronary arteries.\n\nRequirements\n- If the modifier 'G' (coronary artery bypass grafts) is applicable, the Plaque Burden should be 'None'.\n- If there is a graft and the stenosis is 70% or higher, classify it as 4A only if the stenosis occurs in a branch not connected to the graft.\n- When encountering descriptive ranges like 'mild to moderate', always choose the more severe category. For example, 'mild to moderate' should be categorized as 'moderate'.\n- When presented with a range of stenosis percentages (e.g., '60-70%'), interpret it as the upper end of the range minus 1 (e.g., 69% for '60-70%').\n- When severe stenosis is mentioned in multiple branches or there is stenosis in the left main (LM), carefully review the conditions for CAD-RADS 4B to ensure accurate classification.\n- Do not assign 'None' for the CAD-RADS in any case.
