Used when bypass grafts are present.\n- E: Used only for significant non-atherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities such as dissections, anomalous arteries, aneurysms, vasculitis, fistulas, or extrinsic compression. Does not apply to:\n    - Minor anatomical variants (e.g., short left main, myocardial bridging).\n    - Non-coronary cardiac findings (e.g., valve abnormalities, septal defects).\n    - General cardiac or vascular findings not directly affecting coronary arteries.\n\nRequirements\n- If the modifier 'G' (coronary artery bypass grafts) is applicable, the Plaque Burden should be 'None'.\n- If there is a graft and the stenosis is 70% or higher, classify it as 4A only if the stenosis occurs in a branch not connected to the graft.\n- When encountering descriptive ranges like 'mild to moderate', always choose the more severe category.
